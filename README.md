# Tim's AHK Scripts

## Installation

1. Grab the latest release ZIP from the [releases
   page](https://github.com/t-mart/ahk-scripts/releases) page.
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice.
3. Run the the `.ahk` files you want to use.

## Generating new sounds

Some scripts make use of spoken-word sounds to cue when things happen (such as
loading/reloading the script). These sounds are generated with [AWS
Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/). I use the female Salli voice.

You can generate new sounds by creating a free AWS account and using the web UI
to Polly.

Note that these sounds may be a bit quiet, so you may want to normalize them
with a tool like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

Enjoy!
